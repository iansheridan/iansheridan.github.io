Worked on two major initiatives. Enhancing the development cycle and rebuilding the back-end system for image processing (called Race).

Revised the development cycle for the development team by installing Subversion and training of all developers on the use of said revisioning system (there was none previously). Installed a project management system call Redmine to help track ongoing development for the main website and all other initiatives including Race and normal IT tasks. Also used Capistrano to deploy all the of the team's projects (including PHP apps from the the main website to smaller apps used throughout the company)

Race, an image processing system built with Ruby on Rails, is used to submit images to Stylesight's image search engine (4 million plus images). I am rewriting Race from database architecture to front-end user interface, using Merb 1.0.11, Datamapper 0.9.11 and jQuery. The challenge was to streamline the user workflow and reduce maintenance pain points. This was accomplished by refocusing the DB design on the image, removing user access to the image file system and focusing the user interface on the image.

Used advanced JavaScript with jQuery framework to create interfaces and help manage cross browser compatibility.  
Used Ruby On Rails, Merb, Sinatra, and PHP to code Race and other applications.
