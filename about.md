# About Ian Sheridan

I'm a lifelong New Yorker and artist working in various mediums, now focusing on digital abstract art using tools like Procreate and an Apple Pencil. After 18+ years in DevOps, I've transitioned to art, channeling technical precision into creative expression.

Living with Parkinson's Disease (PD) has profoundly shaped my workâ€”relearning skills brings deep satisfaction. Inspired by artists like Ilan Katin, Vincent van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, Keith Haring, Bob Ross, and Pete Draws, my pieces explore emotions through lines, gradients, and playful forms.

My art shares the heart: resilience, humor amid chaos. Check out my NFT collection on [SuperRare](https://superrare.com/iansheridan).
